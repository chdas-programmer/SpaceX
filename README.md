## 🛠️ Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   npm or Yarn package manager

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chdas-programmer/SpaceX.git
cd SpaceX
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the necessary project dependencies using your preferred package manager:

```bash

```

The application should now be running locally, typically accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port specified by Vite).


## 🚀 Usage Examples

After successfully installing and running the application, you can access it via your web browser. Interact with the UI components, forms, and data visualizations to explore its functionalities.

### Basic Interaction

Navigate through the application's pages using the navigation menu. Experiment with input fields and submit forms to see data handling in action.

```typescript
// Example of a component using a Radix UI button
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'; // Assuming shadcn/ui or similar setup

function MyComponent() {
  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log('Button clicked!');
  };

  return (
    <Button onClick={handleClick}>
      Click Me
    </Button>
  );
}
```
